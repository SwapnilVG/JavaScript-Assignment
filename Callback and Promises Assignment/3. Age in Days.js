/*Write a JavaScript function called ageInDays that accepts an object containing a person's first name, last
name, and age in years as input. The function should concatenate the first and last name into a single string
and store it in a variable called fullName. It should then calculate the person's age in days and store it in a
variable called ageInDays.
The ageInDays function should then return a callback function that logs a message to the console. The
message should include the person's full name and age in days, and should be in the format: "The person's full
name is [full name] and their age in days is [age in days]."
Note that the ageInDays function should not log the message to the console directly, but should instead return
a callback function that can be used to log the message at a later time.*/
